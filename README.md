# Machine Learning Approach to Decode Motor-related Activity from ECog Data


#### Background
In this work, we aim to decode the sensory-motor transformation of the ongoing behavior. Given the known literature, localized populations of neurons represent specific directions of movement of external events and motor plans. Using a linear combination of spectral measures and time domain features, Schalk et al (2007, JNE) were able to predict kinematic parameters with an average Pearsonâ€™s r of 0.49, and demonstrate directional tuning of certain populations. We hypothesized that, using updated methodology, we could outperform both the prediction of kinematic parameters, as well as infer further information about the underlying neuronal structures.
